This Repository is a collection of 3 distinctive Machine Learning Projects, all centered around techniques of Linear Regression and Classification.
Task-1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression. 
Task-2: Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest.
Task-3: Iris Flowers Classification.

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I proudly present a trio of captivating machine learning projects, each carefully curated for the realms of house price prediction, wine quality assessment, and classification of iris flowers. These projects have been crafted using datasets sourced from the renowned platform Kaggle.The lifeblood of these projects comes from Kaggle, a celebrated haven for data enthusiasts and machine learning aficionados. The datasets used are accessible on Kaggle.


Project 1: House Price Prediction

In this endeavor, I've engineered a machine learning model employing linear regression to forecast house prices. The journey through the associated Jupyter notebook encompasses the following key stages:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Illuminating Visualizations
3. Transforming Categorical Features into Numeric Form and Scaling Numerical Attributes via MinMax
4. Partitioning Data into Training and Testing Sets
5. Model Creation, Leveraging Linear Regression
6. Calculation of Evaluation Metrics
7. The Thrilling Prospect of Predicting on New Data

You can delve into the code of this project within the House Price Prediction using Linear Regression.ipynb file.

Project 2: Wine Quality Prediction

This project takes you on a compelling voyage into the realm of wine quality prediction, employing both linear regression and the enigmatic random forest. The associated Jupyter notebook script guides you through these essential phases:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Illuminating Visualizations
3. Transforming Categorical Features into Numeric Form and Scaling Numerical Attributes via MinMax
4. Partitioning Data into Training and Testing Sets
5. Model Creation, Leveraging Linear Regression and Random Forest
6. Calculation of Evaluation Metrics for both techniques
7. The Thrilling Prospect of Predicting on New Data
   
You can delve into the code of this project within the Wine Quality Prediction using LR and RF.ipynb file.

Project 3: Iris Flowers Classification

In this third and captivating project, we focus on classifying different species of iris flowers based on the dimensions of their petals and sepals. Logistic regression lends its expertise to this noble task, as presented in the associated Jupyter notebook. The narrative unfolds through the following chapters:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Illuminating Visualizations
3. Transforming Categorical Features into Numeric Form and Scaling Numerical Attributes via MinMax
4. Partitioning Data into Training and Testing Sets
5. Model Creation, Leveraging Linear Regression
6. Calculation of Evaluation Metrics
7. The Thrilling Prospect of Predicting on New Data
